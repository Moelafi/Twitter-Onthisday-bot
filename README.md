# Twitter-Onthisday-bot 

This is a simple bot that I created to excersize playing around with different APIs.
the code builds a Bot which posts daily tweets about things that happened on the date.

It uses the numbers API from: https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1 to get the fact of the day.

it then uses the Twitter API to make the post daily after formatting the tweet.
